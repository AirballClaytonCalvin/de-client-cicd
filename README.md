# Horizontal Controls With 2x2 Graphs

This app demonstrates how to use Dash Design Kit [Controls](https://cs-22.plotly.host/docs/dash-design-kit/controls) and [Menus](https://cs-22.plotly.host/docs/dash-design-kit/menus) within an app that has multiple Graph components.

> This app demonstrates how to use different Dash Design Kit layout components. It doesn't have any callbacks, so interacting with the controls won't update the graphs.

## Run the App

1. Install the required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the app with:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```
